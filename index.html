      <h1>America's lost votes</h1>
        <div class="row">
          <p>If you get convicted in the United States, chances are you lose the right to vote in the elections. Since the United States has the largest prison population per capita in the world, this means that a significant amount of people aren't allowed to vote.</p>
      		<p>According to independent research done by The Sentencing Project[LINK], about 6 million Americans are not allowed to vote because of this. They're disenfranchised, cut out from participating in the democracy that locked them up.</p>
      		<p>Since each state is allowed to make its own laws regarding (ex-)felons voting, numbers of who are most affected are very different for each state.</p>

      <h2>How many people are disenfranchised?</h2>
    		<p>In total, almost <strong>6 million people</strong> cannot vote because they are disenfranchised. This means that 1 in 40 Americans have their voting rights taken away from them.</p>
    		<p>The state of Florida alone houses more than a quarter of all disenfranchised people. The southern state has nearly 1.5 million individuals who aren't allowed to vote.</p>
    		<p>However, looking at percentage of total voting population, there are six states that stand out. In Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tenessee, Virginia and Alabama more than 7 percent of the voting population cannot excercise their democratic right. This number is even higher for African Americans</p>

        <h2>Different state, different law</h2>
        		<p>It's the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution that's responsible for the big difference in disenfranchised people in each state. According to this amendment, each state makes its own laws regarding the voting rights of convicted felons.</p>
        		<p>Only two states allow all people to vote: Maine and Vermont. Then there are several states will allow people on probation and on parole to vote, but not people that are still in jail or prison. Finally, there are a couple of states that won't allow convicted felons to vote even when their parole or probation has ended, effectively banning them from participating in the democratic process.</p>
        		<p>In total, over half of all the disenfranchised are people who have completed their sentence. However, even after their time in prison and finishing their parole and probation they are still not allowed to vote.</p>
