          <h2>What is disenfranchisement</h2>

            <p>If you get convicted in the United States, chances are you lose the right to vote in the elections. Since the United States has the largest prison population per capita in the world, this means that a significant amount of people aren't allowed to vote.</p>

              IMAGE IMAGE

            <p>According to independent research done by <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/" target="_blank">The Sentencing Project</a>, about 6 million Americans are not allowed to vote because of this. They're disenfranchised, cut out from participating in the democracy that locked them up.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text-center">"Being branded as a convicted felon has disconnected me from some important things like voting, social services, financing for my education. Because I am a convicted felon, I have been left out to dry, and I’m not the only one."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Since each state is allowed to make its own laws regarding (ex-)felons voting, numbers of who are most affected are very different for each state.</p>

          <blockquote>

            <h2>How does race play a role?</h2>
            		<p>Voter disenfranchisement is a much bigger problem for African Americans than it is for white Americans and Latinos. Overall one in forty Americans cannot vote because of voter disenfranchisement, but for African Americans this number goes up to one in thirteen.</p>
                <p>For some states, this rate is even higher. In four states black voter disenfranchisement is higher than twenty percent, meaning one in every five African American is not allowed to vote because they once were convicted of a felony crime.</p>

                <p>Some states, however, will not give ex-felons their voting rights after serving their full sentence. For a state like Florida, for example, this means that 1.5 million people who have fully served their sentence, cannot vote again.</p>

              <h2>The United States' high incarceration rate</h2>
                <p>The United States is the country with the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. At present, about 1.5 million people are serving a sentence in an American prison or jail. The country also has the second highest rate of inmates per capita, with almost 700 inmates per 100.000 people.</p>
                <p>This has obviously also led to a steep increase in the amount of disenfranchised voters.</p>

              <h2>The rise in disenfranchisement through the years</h2>
                <p>Because of the rise of the number of prisoners, the amount of disenfranchised voters has also increased rapidly. Especially in states where post-sentence voting is not allowed there is a large number of people who are not allowed to vote.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p class="text-center">"I believe there is a benefit to disenfranchising certain groups of people. When you take the power of voting away from a quarter of a million people in Kentucky alone, that’s a lot of votes. It's a way to keep control."</p>

              <h2>Why does the US have so many inmates?</h2>
                <p>The United States has about five percent of the global population. However, it also has 25% of the global prison population. Since the 1980s, the number of inmates in the US has risen dramatically.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p class="text-center">"I was convicted of a felony over twenty years ago and I’ve been living with that label for two decades now. Because I am a convicted felon, I have been left out to dry, and I’m not the only one."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The main cause for this is the War on Drugs and the harsh sentences for relatively small drug offences. This has led to a rapidly increasing number of prisoners. However, in the last couple of years, the number of incarcerated Americans has dropped somewhat.</p>
